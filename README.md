# What is Parceler?
Parceler is a delivery service platform developed by our team,
DEVengers as a university project for SOEN 343 to demonstrate our
skills in software architecture and design. Parceler includes
features such as shipping quotations, package tracking, payment
processing, and chatbot assistance.

# How does Parceler work?
Parceler enables users to request delivery services by providing
shipment details like destination, weight, and package type. The
system generates a quote, and upon payment, sends an email with a
QR code for package drop-off. Users can track their shipments in
real time on the tracking page.

# Is Parceler a real delivery service?
No, Parceler is not a real delivery service. It is a prototype
developed for academic purposes to demonstrate software
development, database management, and user interface design
skills. Parceler is intended only as an example project and is not
used for actual deliveries.

# What technologies are used to build Parceler?
Parceler is built using modern web development technologies,
including React with TypeScript for frontend, and Node.js with
Express for the backend API. PostgreSQL serves as the database,
managed and initialized using Docker for a consistent environment.
The user interface is designed using Figma and built with
Material-UI (MUI), and Framer Motion for animations. Parceler also
integrates APIs such as Google Maps for address autocomplete and
Stripe for payment processing.

# Who is behind Parceler?
